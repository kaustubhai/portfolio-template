# Contributing to PORTFOLIO-TEMPLATE

:+1::tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the template website
on GitHub. These are just guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgment and
feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Table of Contents

- Steps to contribute
- Issues and Pull Requests
- Commit Messages
- Pull Request Title
- Styles

## Steps to contribute

- Raise a new issue [here](https://github.com/kaustubhai/portfolio-template/issues/new)
- Wait for the maintainer to reach out and assign the issue to you
- Fork the repo and clone it on your local machine
- Get the issue solved
- Read the complete CONTRIBUTING.md file to make sure you follow similar convention
- Create a new branch and open a new pull request with proper convention
- Wait for the maintainer to review or merge it

## Issues and Pull Requests

- If you're not sure about adding something, [open an issue](https://github.com/kaustubhai/portfolio-template/issues/new) to discuss it.
- Feel free to open a Pull Request early so that a discussion can be had as changes are developed.
- Include screenshots and animated gifs of your changes whenever possible.

### Commit Messages

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification to standardize our commit history. To enforce this convention on commit messages and/or pull request titles, we use the [Semantic Pull Requests](https://github.com/probot/semantic-pull-requests) bot.

The commit message summary (or pull request title) is constructed by prepending the type of change being made (e.g., feat, fix, refactor), followed by an imperative, present tense sentence (without a period).
Example: `fix: make header bold`

### Pull Request Title

Same as commit messages, prepend the type of change being made (refactor, fix, chore, feat, etc.)
Example: `docs: add linux setup instructions`

## Styles

Stylesheets are written in CSS but are in minified format, and they all live in the `/src/styles`
directory. You can prettify it using any document formatter, but you need to minify again before submitting pull requests

If any of this information confusing, incorrect, or incomplete, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/kaustubhai/portfolio-template/issues/new)
for help.
